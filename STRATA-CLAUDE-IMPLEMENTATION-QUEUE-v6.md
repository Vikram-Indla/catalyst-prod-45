### ⚠ Baseline drift — CRITICAL for interpretation

The QA reports were run against **`main@014875a86`**. Current HEAD is **`eb1b5be64`**, **7 commits ahead**. Commits between the QA baseline and now already target several waves' defects, so the report's "Actual" observations may be stale and **every defect is re-verified against current code before any fix**:

| Commit | Targets | Wave |
|---|---|---|
| `01d474669` fix: zero-progress health reads Not Started | V5-OPEN-023 | 3 |
| `eda0c36ab` fix: unsaved-changes guard on authoring forms | V5-OPEN-022 | 2 |
| `268738ec6` / `6ab3642c8` / `dd5d8596a` canonical 5-perspective model + Admin CRUD | V3-OPEN-011 | 4 |

Recent migrations already authored (committed, application state unknown): `..benefit_value_reject_negative` (021), `..milestone_name_unique_per_card` (017), `..dependency_name_authoring` (006), `..health_not_started_precedence` (023), `..canonical_perspective_model` (011).

**Implication:** Wave verification must confirm/deny each of these against the live build and the schema; do not re-implement what is already delivered, and do not assume delivered == correct.

### WAVE 1 defect table

| ID | Sev | Route/Component | Status | Root cause | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| STRATA-E2E-001 | P0 | `StrataExecutionPage.tsx`, `routes.ts`, `useStrata.tsx` | ROOT-CAUSED | (a) `elementsReady=!elementsQ.isLoading` false-passes while query disabled → unfiltered flash (~L465/485); (b) detail URL omits `?cycle=` → refresh falls back to DB-active cycle, theme drops (`themeById` from wrong cycle) | — |
| STRATA-E2E-002 | P1 | `useStrata.tsx` | ALREADY DELIVERED (`a02b9c569`); residual = 001(b) detail-nav gap | top-level `?cycle/?period` restore works | — |
| STRATA-E2E-013 | P1 | `vmoAuthoring.tsx`, `domain/index.ts:437` | **BLOCKED (D-2)** | Selector is unfiltered `select('*')`. But: no `cycle_id` on card, `organization_id` NULL on all rows (single-tenant), Vikram ruling = portfolios NOT cycle-scoped. Twin dedupe already fixed (`bea18dffd`). Cycle/tenant scoping contradicts approved decision `STRATA_E2E_PARKED_DECISIONS_013_011.md` | — |
| STRATA-E2E-018 | P1 | `StrataPortfolioVmoPage.tsx`, `routes.ts`, `useStrata.tsx` | ROOT-CAUSED (part b) | index reset already fixed (`168d7f371`); benefit route has no portfolio slot → page falls back to `portfolios[0]` → wrong benefit. `valueApi.benefitBySlug` exists but unused, no `useBenefitBySlug` hook | — |
| V4-OPEN-020 | P1 | `StrataExecutionPage.tsx` | ALREADY DELIVERED (`7d6c38cc8`) — all filters URL-persisted, clean | no residual | — |
| V6-OPEN-027 | P0 | `ProjectCardDetailView.tsx:509`, `authoring.tsx`, RPC `strata_update_project_card` | ROOT-CAUSED (UI+server) | Create form has `required:true` (`StrataExecutionPage.tsx:1007`); Edit form omits it (`ProjectCardDetailView.tsx:509`); `isClearable={!field.required}` lets it clear; `p_clear_theme` → RPC L325 sets NULL unconditionally. Fix: UI required + RPC null-guard (+ optional NOT NULL migration w/ backfill) | — |
| V6-OPEN-029 | P1 | RPC `strata_create_project_card`, `domain/index.ts` | ROOT-CAUSED (server) | no name uniqueness; `20260706101000` dropped it to a `source_key`-only partial index → manual cards unconstrained; slug auto-dedupes so dups insert; no `cycle_id` (derive via theme→cycle). Fix: uniqueness guard in RPC scoped to non-archived + cycle-via-theme; migration | — |
| V6-OPEN-030 | P1 | `domain/index.ts:437`, `shared.tsx:947`, `StrataExecutionPage.tsx:484`, `StrataStrategyElementDetailPage.tsx:188` | ROOT-CAUSED (client) | `stage='archived'` free text; list select + `computeCardRollup` + `groupCards` + theme-detail all consume unfiltered set. Fix: exclude archived at source/derivation (no migration) | — |

**Cluster A shared fix pattern:** detail-route builders (`Routes.strata.*`) + `navigate()` call sites don't carry `?cycle/?period`; destinations fall back to `cycles[active]`/`portfolios[0]`. Fix = (1) propagate context params on detail navigation, and (2) resolve governing context from the fetched entity (project card → its theme's cycle; benefit → its `portfolio_id`). Consistent with existing `usePortfolioBySlug`/`?portfolio=`.

### WAVE 1 — DELIVERY RECORD

**Status:** implemented on `strata/v6-qa-remediation`, commit **`2da235e01`**. Client fixes are HMR-live and browser-verified; server guards ship as an **unapplied** migration (D-1). All items below are `FIXED — PENDING INDEPENDENT RETEST` unless noted.

| ID | Disposition | Change | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| STRATA-E2E-001 | FIXED — PENDING RETEST | (a) `isLoading` now waits on the active cycle's elements; `elementsReady=elementsQ.isSuccess` — no unfiltered flash. (b) `openCard()` appends `?cycle/?period`; Theme-detail nav appends the theme's cycle | Browser: FY27 held on spinner then rendered exactly **2** cards, no 44-flash |
| STRATA-E2E-002 | VERIFIED ALREADY DELIVERED | top-level cycle URL-persist (`a02b9c569`); detail-nav residual closed by 001(b) | — |
| STRATA-E2E-013 | **BLOCKED — D-2** | not implemented: cycle/tenant scoping contradicts approved ruling; twin dedupe already shipped | — |
| STRATA-E2E-018 | FIXED — PENDING RETEST | new `useBenefitBySlug`; benefit route resolves owning Portfolio from `portfolio_id` atomically | Browser: `/benefits/zztest-qa-portfolio-benefit` → **QA** Portfolio + members, not Growth |
| V4-OPEN-020 | VERIFIED ALREADY DELIVERED | all filters URL-persisted (`7d6c38cc8`) | — |
| V6-OPEN-027 | FIXED — PENDING RETEST | UI: `required:true` on Edit Theme field. Server: `strata_update/create_project_card` reject null-theme result (migration `20260712130000`) | UI type-checked; server unapplied (D-1) |
| V6-OPEN-029 | FIXED — PENDING RETEST | Server: normalized name uniqueness per cycle-via-theme, non-archived, in create+update RPC (migration `20260712130000`) | server unapplied (D-1); DB hard-constraint noted as follow-up (no `cycle_id` column) |
| V6-OPEN-030 | FIXED — PENDING RETEST | `filteredCards` + Theme-detail `themeCards` exclude `stage='archived'` unless Delivery Status=Archived is explicitly chosen | Browser: FY27 Total **3→2**, archived duplicate gone from counts/theme rollup |

**Files changed (client):** `StrataExecutionPage.tsx`, `StrataStrategyElementDetailPage.tsx`, `StrataPortfolioVmoPage.tsx`, `ProjectCardDetailView.tsx`, `hooks/useStrata.tsx` (exported `ctxToken`, added `useBenefitBySlug`).
**Migration (unapplied):** `supabase/migrations/20260712130000_strata_project_card_theme_required_and_name_unique.sql` — `CREATE OR REPLACE` of both project-card RPCs (identical signatures) + non-destructive reconciliation `RAISE NOTICE` reporting existing orphan-theme and duplicate-name rows.
**Validation:** `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, 0 errors; `eslint` 0 errors (pre-existing react-refresh warnings only). Browser verification: 001a, 018b, 030 confirmed live.
**Migration/rollback:** forward = `CREATE OR REPLACE` (idempotent, no schema drop); rollback = re-apply `20260706231000` definitions. No data mutated; reconciliation is report-only.
**Regression scope for retest:** Execution all six views + counts/rollups; project-card create/edit (theme-required, duplicate-name); archived history view (`Delivery Status=Archived` still lists archived); benefit deep link + Portfolio index (`?portfolio=` still governs index); cycle switch (no cross-cycle flash).

### WAVE 1 — Schema/RPC enforcement map (investigator reference, verified on current code)

Canonical tables: `strata_project_cards`, `strata_strategy_elements` (theme/objective, has `cycle_id NOT NULL`), `strata_cycles`, `strata_portfolios`, `strata_portfolio_memberships`, `strata_benefits`, `strata_benefit_values`, `strata_milestones`, `strata_risks`, `strata_dependencies`.

Enforcement findings driving Wave 1:
- **027 Theme:** `strata_project_cards.theme_id uuid REFERENCES strata_strategy_elements ON DELETE SET NULL`, **nullable**. Trigger `strata_validate_project_card_theme` fires only `WHERE theme_id IS NOT NULL` (type check, not presence). `strata_create/update_project_card` take `p_theme DEFAULT NULL`. → server does NOT require a Theme.
- **029 name:** no unique index/constraint on `name` at any scope. `slug` is UNIQUE but auto-deduped (`-2/-3`), so identical names both insert. **No `cycle_id` on the card table** → cycle is derived via `theme_id → strata_strategy_elements.cycle_id`. Only existing uniqueness: `(source_system, source_key) WHERE source_key IS NOT NULL` (Jira/import), manual cards unconstrained.
- **030 archived:** `stage` is free text (no CHECK). Only reference to `'archived'` is an edit-block in `strata_update_project_card`. **No** list/rollup/health RPC filters archived: `strata_calc_execution_progress` (only special-cases `on_hold`), `strata_needs_attention` project branches (10/11/12), `strata_calc_value_at_risk` all include archived. Portfolio `status='archived'` and benefit `lifecycle_stage='closed'` also never excluded from VaR.
- Health precedence (`strata_calc_execution_progress`, latest `20260712110000`): `on_hold → not_available → not_started (actual=0 & baseline>0) → forecast-delay(>30d) → variance(≥20 major / ≥10 minor) → on_track`. **V5-OPEN-023 already delivered** here.
- Already-landed server guards: negative benefit value (`20260712100000`), milestone name unique per card (`20260712101000` — real `UNIQUE INDEX (project_card_id, lower(btrim(name)))`), dependency `name` persistence (`20260712102000`).

## DECISION LOG (product decisions that block specific items — work continues around them)

| # | Question | Affected | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | No Supabase project linked in this checkout and no immutable-staging target supplied. Migrations will be authored + committed **unapplied**; who applies them, to which env, and when? | all DB-backed fixes | OPEN — non-blocking (author unapplied per CLAUDE.md) |
| D-2 | Wave 1 outcome #5 requires the Portfolio member selector be "tenant- and cycle-scoped." Current code + a Vikram-approved ruling (`STRATA_E2E_PARKED_DECISIONS_013_011.md`) hold that (a) portfolios are canonically NOT cycle-scoped and (b) tenant scoping is impossible today (single-tenant, `organization_id` NULL everywhere, no `organizations` table) and is deferred to a separate multi-tenancy initiative. **Options:** (A) honor the existing decision — leave 013 as-is (twin dedupe already shipped), keep it parked [recommended]; (B) override the ruling and build cycle-scoping via card→theme→cycle (contradicts approved decision, changes selector semantics — a project card can legitimately belong to a portfolio across cycles); (C) fast-track the multi-tenancy initiative (large, cross-cutting, out of Wave 1 scope). **Recommendation: A.** Impact: without a decision, 013 stays BLOCKED and is not counted as fixed. | STRATA-E2E-013 | OPEN — needs Vikram |
