# Session 023 — Phase 5 implementation (configuration & system states)

**Feature Work ID:** CAT-STRATA-IMPL-20260712-001 · **Date:** 2026-07-16
**Branch:** `strata/impl-phase01` · Plan Lock `03_PLAN_LOCK_PHASE5.md` APPROVED (commit `3e215d4ed`, on main).
**Authorization:** Vikram "approved, implement full phase 5" — build 5A→5G, commit + fast-forward-merge each slice
when gates green AND live-verified. Stop for drift / decision / regression / migration.
**Gates each slice:** `npx tsc --noEmit` · `npm run lint:colors:gate` · `npm run audit:ads:gate` · `npm run lint:cre`.
Merge: push branch → `git push origin <sha>:main` (fast-forward). Map protection = HARD gate (byte-diff each slice).

## Slice 5A — Config Landing (anchor 03, P5-D0) ✅ built + gate-green + live-verified
**File:** `src/modules/strata/pages/StrataAdminConfigPage.tsx` (only file touched).
- Bare `/strata/admin` now renders `AdminLanding` (governed control plane) instead of silently falling to tab 0.
  `:section` deep-links keep the existing 12-tab page unchanged (transitional per P5-D0).
- Landing = "Governed control plane" lozenge + context line (strata_admin-aware) + **approval band** (real
  `pending_approval` counts aggregated across 8 governed hooks — perspectives/models/thresholds/value-cats/gates/
  kpi-types/templates/workflows — routed to the section where each is actioned) + **6 consequence-domain cards**
  (Strategy framework · Measurement · Value & governance · Data & integration · Workflow & access · Reference &
  display) each → its primary `:section` today + **reused `<ChangeLogSection/>`** (change requests + audit trail).
- Domain cards repoint to `/admin/measurement` · `/admin/data` · `/admin/access` as 5B/5E/5F land.
- **Honest scope:** anchor's "Downstream impact" change-log column deferred (P5-D2 — no server impact RPC); change
  log shows only columns backed by data. Nothing fabricated.
- Gates: tsc clean · colors 0/0 · audit 19798/19798 (no increase) · CRE passed.
- Live (localhost:8080, tab 2014055366): light + dark both clean; strata_admin context line + "All approved" band +
  6 cards + "No change requests" empty state render; console errors all pre-existing/unrelated (feature-flag +
  session-timeout noise + `/src/pages/admin/components/*` routeSmokeCheck — different admin area). No error boundary.
- Map untouched (bare route + landing only; no map import).

## Slice 5B — Measurement domain + Taxonomy (anchor 04, P5-D1/D2/D3) ✅ built + gate-green + live-verified
**Files:** `StrataMeasurementPage.tsx` (NEW) · `StrataAdminConfigPage.tsx` (export Gov* + 3 sections, repoint measurement
card) · `StrataRoutes.tsx` (+`admin/measurement` route, static, outranks `:section`) · `routes.ts` (+adminMeasurement/
adminData/adminAccess builders) · `domain/index.ts` (+`allModelPerspectives` reader) · `hooks/useStrata.tsx`
(+`useAllModelPerspectives`).
- `/strata/admin/measurement`: left section-nav (Perspectives & taxonomy / Scorecard models / KPI types & formulas /
  Threshold schemes) + "← Configuration" back. Per-nav pending badges. Units & currencies omitted (no backing data —
  zero-assumption).
- **Perspectives sub-view (anchor 04):** JiraTable (Perspective name+desc · Weight · **Used by** [client-derived model
  count from new reader, P5-D2] · Lifecycle) + **weight-integrity header** ("WEIGHTS TOTAL 100" — sums APPROVED
  perspectives; retired ESG excluded, verified = 100) + retired footer + **360px edit rail** (select row → name/desc,
  GovEnvelope [v·status·effective·approved·reason], fields, **IMPACT PREVIEW** = usage count + immutable-history note +
  "score-shift preview not yet available", GovActions lifecycle, + approved-record "revising creates a new version — later
  feature, retire+recreate" note per P5-D3).
- Scorecard models / KPI types / Threshold schemes nav items reuse the existing governed sections (5C/5D refine in place).
- **New reader `allModelPerspectives`** = plain unfiltered select on `strata_scorecard_model_perspectives` (same table+RLS
  as modelPerspectives) — no migration, allowed by Plan Lock "thin additive reader".
- Gates: tsc clean · colors 0/0 · audit 19798/19798 (no increase) · CRE passed.
- Live (localhost:8080): light + dark clean; nav switches sections; Financial row → rail shows v1·APPROVED envelope,
  "Used by 2 scorecard models", honest deferral notes, Retire action; breadcrumb "STRATA / Administration / Measurement"
  (fixed initial dup). Console errors all pre-existing/unrelated (`/src/pages/admin/components/*` routeSmokeCheck). No
  error boundary. Map untouched.

## Slice 5C — Model Builder (anchor 05, scoped P5-D3) ✅ built + gate-green + live-verified
**File:** `StrataAdminConfigPage.tsx` (only — enhances `ScorecardModelsSection`, shown in BOTH the measurement shell and
the old tab).
- **Anchor 05 re-read IN FULL via DesignSync** (was HANDOFF one-liner). Signature element = tri-state MODEL INTEGRITY band
  ("Cannot submit until integrity checks pass"); draft-first builder with perspective groups → measures. **Backend reality:
  no model-measure table exists** (grep confirmed) + no draft-create/preview/diff RPC → per P5-D3 the measure-level builder,
  preview-with-data and version-diff are DEFERRED (labelled), and the backed core is built.
- Added `ModelIntegrityBand` (tri-state from perspective-weight sum via `useAllModelPerspectives`): △ none / ✓ total 100 /
  ✕ total N — assign/remove; glyph+word carry state (no color-alone). "Cannot submit until integrity passes" when invalid.
- `GovActions` + `GovRecordCard` gained `submitBlockedReason` — draft Submit is disabled WITH a visible inline reason
  (anchor 05 "never a silent disable") when a model's weights ≠ 100. Approve stays DB-SoD-gated.
- Section intro states the governed scope + names the deferred features honestly.
- Reuses existing `ModelWeights` editor (weights authoring already backed by `setModelPerspectiveWeights`).
- Gates: tsc clean · colors 0/0 · audit 19798/19798 (no increase) · CRE passed.
- Live: measurement shell → Scorecard models nav → both approved models show MODEL INTEGRITY ✓ total 100 (40/35/25 and
  30/25/10/20/15), WEIGHTS VALID, Edit weights, Retire; intro deferral note visible. No console errors, no error boundary.
  Map untouched.

## ⏭ NEXT: 5D — Threshold Schemes (anchor 25, scoped P5-D3). Re-read anchor 25 in full at slice start.
