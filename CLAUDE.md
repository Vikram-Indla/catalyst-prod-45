## 2026-04-28 — v4 skill rewrite: 3-lane logical-parallel model
**Surface:** skill itself
**Pattern:** v3 was 1350 lines, screenshot-mandatory, doc-heavy, single-tool (Chrome MCP only). Loop ran open-ended without a hard cap and without a CRUD acceptance test, so audits closed on visual match alone and shipped wiring defects.
**Rule:** Three lanes (Chrome MCP, Rovo/Atlassian MCP, Computer Use) report OBSERVATION before DIFF. CRUD on a canonical entity is the acceptance gate. Loop capped at 5 cycles. No standalone docs — only prompt blocks, MONITOR block, JIRA bug filings, and lessons here.

## 2026-04-24 — Rovo prompts need full probe payload
**Surface:** any
**Pattern:** Asking Rovo "what primitive is this?" without DOM context wastes a round — Rovo cannot infer from a screenshot alone.
**Rule:** Every Rovo prompt block must include the element's className, computed styles, and data-attrs from the Lane A probe. Rovo gets what Claude saw.

## 2026-04-24 — Visual match is not parity
**Surface:** any
**Pattern:** Surfaces declared "parity-complete" on visual match shipped wiring defects (composer doesn't submit, reaction increments visually but doesn't persist).
**Rule:** CRUD parity at C, R, U, D is the acceptance gate. Visual match without CRUD green is a fail. If a surface has no interactive behaviour in scope, state it explicitly and require Vikram sign-off.
