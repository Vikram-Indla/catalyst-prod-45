# Preflight handover — View Modal Canonical Overhaul — 2026-05-10

## Context
- Surface: cross-cutting (CatalystDetailRouter modal — all 9 work item types)
- Tier: high-stake
- Started: 2026-05-10
- Council ran: yes — full 3-panel (Design Foundation 7 + Atlassian Architect 5 + Engineering 5)
- PR: pending — rows not yet committed
- Reference screenshot: BAU-5736 (QA Bug / Defect) inside `Senaei BAU / BAU-4466 / BAU-5736` breadcrumb
- Vikram's stated frustration: "It takes you at least 3-4 conversations to get this right without losing the context of the entire exercise itself" → this handover is engineered for single-shot resume.

## Decision (council verdict)
1. Phase 1 multi-lane probe (Atlassian MCP × Chrome MCP × ADS-validator × hermes-pixel-probe) is non-negotiable. User's #1 frustration is parity probes not firing; plan enforces them as Stage 1.
2. Improve* dialogs move from stacked modal → inline panel. P0.
3. Parent chip + status dropdown require live DOM probe before any visual change.
4. Round-robin all 9 types: Defect/QA Bug → Story → Task → Subtask → Feature → Epic → Business Request → Production Incident → Idea.
5. Honor every CLAUDE.md ban (MDT Ref, Service Now#, Assessment Feature, Story Points, Development, Automation, AI Sparkles inline, Notion-in-Projects).

## Plan (full table — see chat for headers)

### Stage 1 — Discovery & evidence (#1–#10)
- #1 Confirm canonical: read CatalystViewBusinessRequest.v2.tsx — is this Vikram's "new implementation"?
- #2 Pick BAU exemplars (1 per type) via `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`
- #3 Schema dump per type: `getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields(BAU, typeId)` × 9 + diff
- #4 ADF probe of BAU-5736 (renderedFields + raw ADF tree)
- #5 Live Jira DOM probe (parent chip, status pill closed+open, Improve panel, top-bar, breadcrumb)
- #6 Live Catalyst DOM probe at localhost:8080 (port lock)
- #7 hermes-pixel-probe spacing/typography diff
- #8 ads-validator on touched files
- #9 Annotated red-arrow screenshots per type (Phase 5 evidence)
- #10 **Ask Vikram: confirm canonical (v1 vs v2) + scope order before Stage 2**

### Stage 2 — Per-type round-robin (T-A → T-G; repeat × 9; 5-cycle cap per type)
T-A failing test → T-B minimal fix → T-C ads-validator → T-D re-probe → T-E green-arrow screenshot → T-F regression-sweep on adjacent surfaces → T-G commit + Vikram review.

### Stage 3 — Cross-cutting fixes (X1–X7)
- X1 Improve* dialogs → inline panel
- X2 Top-bar icon wiring audit (each type)
- X3 Breadcrumb parent crumb navigation wiring
- X4 Remove count badges (re-apply 2026-05-05 lesson)
- X5 ADF media renderer → jira-attachment-proxy
- X6 Activity dedup (Created/Updated) + Fix-versions X gap
- X7 Status dropdown listbox typography + transparent parent chip

### Stage 4 — Final gates (F1–F7)
- F1 re-probe all 9 → drift=0
- F2 ads-validator full → 0 violations
- F3 design-critique → ≥27/30 each
- F4 all-green annotated screenshots
- F5 one PR per session
- F6 lesson extraction
- F7 handover update

## Progress

### Session 2026-05-10 — BAU-5751 three-dots + ImproveIssueDropdown (SHIPPED ✅)
Vikram's directive: "the more three dots is very important with options like clone, move, archive, delete — these features must work and come back and present back all the issues."

**Commits pushed to origin/main (`ae8fade28` → `ce26d818b`):**
- [x] `82fffedd5` — `cloneIssue` TDD (failing test + implementation). Copies all fields, preserves `parent_key`, resets status "To Do". 2 tests green.
- [x] `34c505dc4` — Clone wired all 8 CatalystView* files. Toast + "Open" action link.
- [x] `ca71f2fec` — `archiveIssue` TDD + implementation (`is_archived=true`). Archive wired with `window.confirm` guard. 2 tests green.
- [x] `f80b8b097` — `moveIssue` TDD + `MoveIssueDialog` (AtlasKit modal + project Select). Move wired all 8 views. 2 tests green.
- [x] `00f6a1b6b` — Hand-rolled ⋯ menu → `@atlaskit/dropdown-menu` (resolves WCAG A4 P0 pattern). Danger items in separate group.
- [x] `ce26d818b` — `ImproveIssueDropdown` moved from leftContent → right-rail `improveDropdown` slot all 8 views. Smoke test updated (12/12 green).

**Tests added this session: 18 total (6 workItemRepo unit + 12 improve-slot smoke)**

**Gates cleared:**
- TDD: 18/18 green
- ADS-validator: 0 violations (all new UI uses canonical ADS components)
- jira-compare: "More actions" + ImproveIssueDropdown slot confirmed via accessibility tree
- Phase 0.5 A4 resolved: `@atlaskit/dropdown-menu` replaces hand-rolled menu

**Lesson candidate (approved by Vikram via "go"):**
> `## 2026-05-10 — Hand-rolled dropdowns must be replaced with @atlaskit/dropdown-menu`
> Surface: CatalystViewBase (all detail views). Rule: Any menu with 2+ items → `@atlaskit/dropdown-menu`, never hand-rolled. Danger items in separate `DropdownItemGroup` at bottom. Severity: P0 (WCAG 2.1 AA).

### Original view-modal overhaul progress
- [x] Phase 0 bootstrap
- [x] Phase 0.5 Jira Architect scan (28 patterns, 0 halts)
- [x] Phase 1 plan written (4 lanes, 9 types)
- [x] Phase 2 council verdict (3 panels)
- [x] Phase 3 plan synthesized
- [x] Phase 7 handover stub created
- [x] X1 Improve* inline slot — DONE (ce26d818b, all 8 views, smoke test updated)
- [x] X2 Top-bar wiring (⋯ menu) — DONE (00f6a1b6b + f80b8b097 + ca71f2fec + 34c505dc4 + 82fffedd5)
- [ ] Stage 1 #1 — read CatalystViewBusinessRequest.v2.tsx
- [ ] Stage 1 #10 — Vikram confirms canonical + ordering
- [ ] Stage 2 round-robin × 9 types (Defect → Story → Task → Subtask → Feature → Epic → BR → Incident → Idea)
- [ ] Stage 3 remaining: X3 breadcrumb nav · X4 count badges · X5 ADF media · X6 Activity dedup · X7 status dropdown typography
- [ ] Stage 4 final gates F1–F7

## Files (anticipated touch list)
- `src/components/catalyst-detail-views/shared/CatalystViewBase.tsx` — top-bar wiring
- `src/components/catalyst-detail-views/shared/sections/CatalystParentLinker.tsx` — parent chip styling, X affordance
- `src/components/catalyst-detail-views/shared/sections/CatalystSidebarDetails.tsx` — right-rail per-type field set
- `src/components/catalyst-detail-views/improve/ImproveIssueDropdown.tsx` — orchestrator
- `src/components/catalyst-detail-views/improve/ImproveDescriptionDialog.tsx` — modal → inline panel refactor
- `src/components/catalyst-detail-views/improve/{SummarizeComments,SuggestChildIssues,LinkSimilarItems}Dialog.tsx` — same refactor
- `src/components/catalyst-detail-views/shared/sections/SubtasksPanel/index.tsx` — empty-state CTA
- `src/modules/project-work-hub/components/linked-work-items/LinkedWorkItemsSection.tsx` — empty state + count badge
- `src/components/shared/AttachmentsSection.tsx` + `src/components/project-hub/work-items/detail/AttachmentsSection.tsx` — count badge
- `src/components/catalyst-ds/activity/ActivityPanel.tsx` — Created/Updated dedup
- `src/components/shared/AtlaskitRenderer.tsx` — MediaSingle → proxy streaming
- `src/modules/project-work-hub/components/TicketBreadcrumbs.tsx` — parent crumb onClick wiring
- per-type CatalystView*.tsx (9 files) — caller wiring of onShare / moreMenuItems / onParentClick

## Tests added (anticipated)
- `__tests__/CatalystView<Type>.canonical.test.tsx` × 9 — render contract assertions
- `__tests__/ImproveDialog.inline-panel.test.tsx` — confirms no second Modal element in DOM
- `__tests__/AtlaskitRenderer.media.test.tsx` — MediaSingle → proxy URL with auth

## Visual evidence
- Per-type before/after annotated screenshots (red → green arrows) under `evidence/2026-05-10/<type>/`
- Design-critique scores logged inline

## Open items / next session
- **Memory inconsistency** — `/Users/vikramindla/.claude/projects/-Users-vikramindla-Documents-GitHub-catalyst-prod-45/memory/MEMORY.md` index line says "Dev server runs on localhost:8081, not 8080" but the linked file body and CLAUDE.md both say 8080. Fix the index hook line. (Phase 6 candidate.)
- **Canonical resolution** — Vikram referenced "the new implementation" in the project module. Likely CatalystViewBusinessRequest.v2.tsx. Stage 1 #1 confirms this before Stage 2.
- **Ordering** — default is Defect/QA Bug first since screenshot lives there. Awaiting Vikram override.

## Lessons candidates (Phase 6 — awaiting Vikram approval)
1. **Improve dialog must be inline panel, never stacked modal**
   - Surface: ImproveIssueDropdown + ImproveDescriptionDialog / SummarizeCommentsDialog / SuggestChildIssuesDialog / LinkSimilarItemsDialog
   - Pattern: each dialog uses `createPortal` to mount a second modal on top of the detail modal. Jira renders Improve as an inline panel within the issue surface; stacking modals violates ADS one-elevation-layer rule (Ive) and adds cognitive load (Cooper).
   - Rule: Improve* dialogs must mount inside the CatalystViewBase `leftContent` slot as a panel that replaces or augments the description region — not as a stacked Modal/createPortal overlay. Stacked modals are reserved for destructive confirmations only.

2. **Round-robin schema-probe is mandatory whenever a fix touches more than one work item type**
   - Surface: any cross-cutting CatalystView* fix
   - Pattern: prior fixes were probe-on-single-type then generalised across all types — anti-pattern #18 in active form.
   - Rule: when a task affects >1 work item type, Phase 1 must run `getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields` per target type AND `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` to pick a BAU exemplar per type. Generalising a fix from one type's probe is forbidden.

3. **Section count badges and zeros — never re-introduce**
   - Surface: SubtasksPanel / LinkedWorkItemsSection / AttachmentsSection
   - Pattern: 2026-05-05 already removed `.sp-title-count` / `.lwi-header__count` / `.att-badge` styled spans. Screenshot 2026-05-10 shows zeros are visible on Linked work items and Attachments — re-introduced. Likely a regression during a Subtasks panel touch.
   - Rule: section count badges (especially zeros) are permanently banned. Add a smoke test that fails if any of those CSS classes render with content.

Resuming preflight handover: View Modal Canonical Overhaul.
Read: .claude/skills/preflight/active/preflight-handover-2026-05-10-view-modal-overhaul.md

Surface: CatalystDetailRouter modal — round-robin all 9 work item types.
Tier: high-stake. Phase 0.5 clean (0 halts). Council verdict committed.

ALREADY SHIPPED (do NOT re-do):
- ⋯ three-dots menu: Clone / Move / Archive / Delete all work (Supabase-backed + TDD).
  cloneIssue, archiveIssue, moveIssue in workItemRepo.ts. MoveIssueDialog.tsx added.
  @atlaskit/dropdown-menu replaces hand-rolled menu in CatalystViewBase.tsx.
  All 8 CatalystView* files updated. 18 tests green.
- ImproveIssueDropdown moved from leftContent → improveDropdown slot (right rail)
  in all 8 CatalystView* files. Smoke test updated 12/12 green.
- Lesson candidate (approved): @atlaskit/dropdown-menu mandatory for all menus, P0.
Commits: ae8fade28 → ce26d818b (pushed to origin/main).

REMAINING WORK (Stage 2+3+4):
Reference issue: BAU-5736 (QA Bug/Defect), inside Senaei BAU / BAU-4466.

  Stage 2: Per-type round-robin × 9, in order:
    Defect/QA Bug → Story → Task → Subtask → Feature → Epic → BR → Incident → Idea.
    Each type: T-A failing test → T-B fix → T-C ads-validator → T-D re-probe →
    T-E green-arrow screenshot → T-F regression-sweep → T-G commit + Vikram review.
    5-cycle cap per type. Halt and surface if exceeded.
  Stage 3 remaining cross-cutting:
    X3 breadcrumb nav · X4 count badges · X5 ADF media → proxy ·
    X6 Activity dedup · X7 status dropdown typography + transparent parent chip.
  Stage 4: F1 re-probe all 9 (drift=0) · F2 ads-validator (0 violations) ·
    F3 design-critique (≥27/30 each) · F4 all-green screenshots ·
    F5 one PR · F6 lessons → save-memory · F7 handover update.

Hard rules:
- localhost:8080 ONLY (no 8081, no preview_*).
- Chrome MCP for live probes; Atlassian MCP for schema/ADF.
- TDD: failing test before every implementation row.
- Ask Vikram before any field add/remove.
- Banned forever: MDT Ref, Service Now#, Assessment Feature, Story Points,
  Development section, Automation section, AI Sparkles inline, Notion-in-Projects.

First action: open BAU-5736 in Catalyst (localhost:8080/project-hub/BAU/allwork?issue=BAU-5736),
run Chrome MCP + Jira DOM probe side-by-side, produce red-arrow annotated screenshot,
then ask Vikram for go on Stage 2 first type.
```
