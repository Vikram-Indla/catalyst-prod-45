# GOD MODE DELIVERY MANUAL
### Catalyst full-stack AI delivery operating model — skills audit + SDLC SOP
**Date:** 2026-07-08 · **Auditor:** Fable 5 · **Evidence:** 3 parallel read-only audits of every SKILL.md across project (`.claude/skills/`, 27 dirs), user (`~/.claude/skills/`, 57 dirs), and plugin runtimes (`~/.claude/plugins/` + Cowork store). Facts cited from files; anything not read is marked **cannot confirm**.

---

## A. EXECUTIVE DIAGNOSIS

The estate is a working system buried under three layers of sediment.

1. **Three runtimes, one namespace.** Skills resolve from (a) project `.claude/skills/`, (b) user `~/.claude/skills/`, (c) Claude Code plugins, plus (d) a *separate* Claude Desktop Cowork store (`anthropic-skills:*`, `design:*`, `cowork-plugin-management:*`) that is not under `~/.claude/plugins/` at all. Nine skills exist in 2–3 divergent copies. In every measured case except one, the **project copy is newest and richest** — the project repo is already the de-facto source of truth. The estate just hasn't admitted it.
2. **Documentation lies.** `.claude/skills/README.md` claims a "5-skill stack"; 27 skill dirs exist. `AGENT_PIPELINE.md` rosters only those 5. `/4` cross-references `/1` and `/2` aliases that don't exist. `skillui-catalyst/SKILL.md` is 0 bytes. User-level `catalyst-feature/` and `save-memory/` are empty dirs. User-level `jira-compare` points at **catalyst-prod-44** (repo is -45) and permits port 8081 (banned).
3. **Two competing merge-to-main automations.** `deploy` (git CLI, halts on conflict, gated) and `gitmerge` (drives **GitHub Desktop via computer-use**, auto-merges, auto-deletes remote branches, no PR gate, duplicated byte-identical in the Cowork store). Two mechanisms for the most destructive workflow in the repo is one too many.
4. **One permission-bypass skill.** `hermes-jira-clone` advertises "no permission prompts, no mid-cycle stops … full autonomy" — direct contradiction of the CLAUDE.md commit gate and concurrent-session laws.
5. **Council inflation.** Four deliberation skills (`llm-council`, `advanced-council`, Cowork `council`, `mega`) plus preflight's embedded 17-advisor panel. Without routing, "council this" is a coin flip.
6. **Agent sprawl mirrors skill sprawl.** ~200 boilerplate agent personas (marketing/legal/game-dev/China-commerce) duplicated at user+project level. Seven tiny bespoke agents (<1 KB each: `code-graph-agent`, `repo-context-agent`, `safety-change-control-agent`, `memory-guardrail-agent`, `ui-dom-probe-agent`, `token-efficiency-agent`, `implementation-planner-agent`, `tool-output-agent`) are the only ones wired to real Catalyst work.
7. **Cross-user contamination.** Project `preflight/SKILL.md:105` hardcodes `/Users/jahanarakhan/...`; the orphan CC preflight plugin hardcodes `/Users/vikramindla/...`. Two machines merged into one skill set.
8. **What actually works:** the project-level Catalyst core (`catalyst-feature`, `preflight`, `jira-compare`, `design-critique`, `design-intelligence`, `inspect`, `cre`, `regression`, `deploy`, `advanced-council`, `llm-council`, `fable`, `mirror-component`) plus built-in harness skills (`verify`, `code-review`, `security-review`, `simplify`, `run`, `loop`) plus the repo's ratchet gates (`lint:colors:gate`, `audit:ads:gate` in husky + CI). That is a complete SDLC toolchain. Everything else is duplication, drift, or off-domain.

**Verdict:** you don't need new skills. You need one canonical copy per capability, a router that picks by phase, and gates that are impossible to route around.

## B. DUPLICATE / MERGE / DECOMMISSION MATRIX

Legend: **KEEP** = canonical. **MERGE** = fold content into canonical, delete source. **DECOM** = delete. **QUAR** = keep on disk, remove from invocation path until reviewed. **SPEC** = specialist-only, never auto-invoked.

| Capability | Copies found | Canonical | Others | Reason / risk / migration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| catalyst-feature | project (118L, 06-26) · Cowork AS (06-20) · user (EMPTY dir) | **KEEP project** | DECOM user stub + AS copy | Project is repo-shipped feature OS bound to CLAUDE.md. Risk of stubs: name resolves to nothing. Migration: `rmdir ~/.claude/skills/catalyst-feature` |
| jira-compare | project (461L, 06-24) · user (914L, 05-21, **refs catalyst-prod-44 + port 8081**) · Cowork AS (329L) | **KEEP project** | DECOM user + AS | User copy actively dangerous (stale repo slug, banned port). Migration: delete user dir; `user/jira-compare/CLAUDE.md` lessons log is empty — delete too |
| design-critique | project (600L, 06-24) · user (536L, 06-05) · design plugin (118L generic Figma) | **KEEP project** | DECOM user; **SPEC** design:design-critique | Plugin one is generic mockup feedback, fine for non-Catalyst work only. Never for Catalyst surfaces (no ADS rules) |
| design-intelligence | project (764L, 06-17) · user (699L, 05-10) | **KEEP project** | DECOM user | Project has AGENT_ROSTER + newer lesson anchors |
| systematic-debugging | project (238L, Catalyst-tuned, 06-24) · user (222L, generic Hermes port) | **KEEP project** | DECOM user | Same trigger phrase = wrong-invocation risk |
| preflight | project v3 (695L, 06-17) · orphan CC plugin (455L, unregistered) · Cowork rpm (244L) | **KEEP project — after fixing `jahanarakhan` path at L105** | DECOM orphan plugin dir + Cowork rpm | Three generations of the same planner. Orphan plugin isn't even in installed_plugins.json. Migration: fix path, `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/preflight` |
| gitmerge | project (119L) · Cowork AS (byte-identical) | **DECOM both** | — | Highest-risk skill in estate: GUI automation of GitHub Desktop, auto-merge + permanent remote branch deletion, no PR/review gate. Replacement: `/deploy` (halts on conflict, gated) + `gh` CLI. Migration: delete both; keep this manual's §J as the merge SOP |
| deploy | project only | **KEEP (gated)** | — | Memory-blessed (`project_deploy_skill`). Fix hardcoded repo slug `anthropics/catalyst-prod-45` before it breaks on a remote change |
| llm-council | project (467L) · Cowork AS (identical) | **KEEP project** | DECOM AS copy | Identical bytes — pure duplication |
| advanced-council | project only (883L, 07-01, newest council) | **KEEP** | — | Pre-build contract w/ VeriMAP Plan Lock. Scope: big features only (see §F) |
| council (Cowork AS) | Cowork only (176L) | **DECOM** | — | Third council variant; superseded by advanced-council (superset) |
| mega | user only | **QUAR** | — | "Probing + council + Idea Fencing" grab-bag; overlaps llm-council. Cannot confirm value; review before reuse |
| regression | project (122L, 06-18) · Cowork AS (352L, richer) | **MERGE AS → project, KEEP project** | DECOM AS after merge | Plugin body has route-inventory content project version lacks. Regression without route inventory is shallow (blind spot #4) — merge fixes that |
| hermes-jira-clone | user only | **QUAR** | — | Explicit "no permission prompts / full autonomy" posture violates commit gate + concurrent-session law. If wanted, strip the bypass language first |
| hermes-pixel-probe | user only | **KEEP (SPEC)** | — | Genuinely useful DOM/CSS + functional parity probe; called by jira-compare flow, standalone-triggerable |
| hermes-regression-sweep | user only | **MERGE → project regression** | DECOM after | 3-adjacent-surface sweep is the missing "blast radius" step of /regression |
| hermes-memory/-search/-compress/-route/-insights/-persona/-skill/-traj | user only (generic ported pack, all 05-07 beta) | **QUAR all 8** | — | Overlap harness-native memory + context management. Three memory systems (harness memory dir, hermes-memory, Obsidian vault) = pollution risk (blind spot #7). Harness memory + `anthropic-skills:save-memory` (Obsidian) are canonical; hermes pack redundant |
| catalyst-clone | project only (467L) | **QUAR** | — | Overlaps jira-compare + mirror-component + pixel-twin-route; auto-appends CLAUDE.md **every run** = contract-file pollution. Review before reuse |
| mirror-component | project only | **KEEP** | — | Matches standing feedback: "reuse canonical page, never parallel" |
| pixel-twin-route | project only (945L) | **SPEC** | — | Heavy 10-phase twin machinery; only when an isolated route twin is explicitly requested |
| inspect | project only | **KEEP** | — | Component-level ADS audit/fix with cascade |
| 4 / A / B / C | project only | **KEEP /4** (fix stale /1 /2 refs) · **DECOM A, B, C** | — | A→start, B→design-critique, C→systematic-debugging are 20-line forwarders whose only content is a widget-ban rule. Single-letter names = maximum wrong-invocation risk. Move the widget-ban rule into CLAUDE.md once, delete aliases |
| skillui-catalyst | project only, **0 bytes** | **DECOM** | — | Dead stub |
| start | project only (335L) | **KEEP** | — | Proceed-gated router; becomes the single front door (§K) |
| catalyst-agent | project only (714L + 8 ref files) | **KEEP (SPEC)** | — | Probe-first router; overlaps start. Use for probe/gap-report tasks; start for everything else. If friction persists, merge into start in the 30-day plan |
| fable | project only | **KEEP** | — | Goal→falsifiable-DoD wrapper; pairs with the /goal loop |
| delegate | project only | **KEEP** | — | Cost routing; verify its two hook scripts exist (cannot confirm — not inspected) |
| cre | project only | **KEEP** | — | Rules-engine management; lint:cre is a blocking gate |
| obsidian | project only | **KEEP** | — | Handover transcripts. Distinct from save-memory (vault notes). Keep both, distinct lanes |
| story-writer | project (182L) · Cowork AS | **KEEP project** | DECOM AS | Writes Jira issues — external side effect; always confirm before create |
| github-code-review / github-issues / github-pr-workflow | user only, generic | **SPEC all 3** | — | Built-in `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `gh` CLI supersede for review; issues/pr-workflow fine as references |
| test-driven-development · subagent-driven-development | user only | **KEEP** | — | Method skills, no overlap |
| ads-validator | Cowork AS only | **SPEC** | — | Overlaps repo ratchet gates (`lint:colors:gate`, `audit:ads:gate`) which are canonical + CI-enforced. Use ads-validator only for live-Jira computed-style diffing |
| save-memory / recall-memory / consolidate-memory | Cowork AS (+ empty user save-memory dir) | **KEEP AS trio** · DECOM empty user dir | — | Obsidian vault lane. Scope rule in §I |
| supabase + supabase-postgres-best-practices | CC plugin 0.1.11 (+ project symlinks) | **KEEP** | purge stale 0.1.6 cache | Plugin skill has **no prod/read-only guard** — bind to staging-first law (§I). Symlinks resolve fine |
| caveman plugin (7 skills) | CC plugin | **KEEP** | — | Output-style, orthogonal to SDLC. caveman-commit verified message-only (doesn't run git) |
| docx/pptx/xlsx/pdf, skill-creator, schedule, market-intelligence, ui-ux-pro-max, ui-extraction-react-replication, fable-prompt (Cowork AS) | Cowork | **KEEP** docs+skill-creator+schedule · **cannot confirm** market-intelligence / ui-ux-pro-max / ui-extraction / fable-prompt (bodies not inspected) | — | Un-inspected ones: read before first use, then classify |
| ~30 non-SDLC user skills (solana, polymarket, stable-diffusion, whisper, vllm, sherlock, …) | user | **QUAR (out of SDLC path)** | — | Not harmful, just noise; sherlock (OSINT) has no business in a delivery session |
| ~200 boilerplate agent personas (user + project `.claude/agents/`, duplicated) | both | **QUAR project copies of off-domain packs; KEEP the 8 bespoke <1KB agents + engineering/testing/design subset** | — | Duplication doubles maintenance; off-domain personas (Douyin strategist et al.) dilute agent selection |

**Invocation rule:** when two skills share a name, always invoke the plain (project) name; namespaced (`anthropic-skills:*`, `design:*`) only when this table says so explicitly.

---

## D. FULL-STACK AI TEAM STRUCTURE

Sixteen roles. Each is a *hat* the session (or a subagent) wears — not 16 simultaneous agents. One accountable owner per phase, always.

| # | Role | Carried by | Primary skills | Backup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Product Owner | Vikram (human) + Product Manager agent as drafter | `catalyst-feature`, `fable` | `llm-council` |
| 2 | Business Analyst | Product Manager agent | `story-writer`, `anthropic-skills:market-intelligence` | `deep-research` |
| 3 | UX Researcher | UX Researcher agent | `design:user-research`, `design:research-synthesis` | — |
| 4 | UI Designer | UI Designer agent + Figma MCP | `design:design-handoff`, Figma tools | `design:ux-copy` |
| 5 | Design System Auditor | main session | `design-intelligence`, `inspect`, ratchet gates | `ads-validator` (live diff only) |
| 6 | Solution Architect | Plan agent / Software Architect agent | `preflight`, `advanced-council` | `code-graph-agent` |
| 7 | Frontend Dev | main session | `test-driven-development`, `mirror-component`, `inspect fix` | `subagent-driven-development` |
| 8 | Backend Dev | main session / Backend Architect agent | `test-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging` | — |
| 9 | DB/Supabase Engineer | main session | `supabase` plugin, migration ledger discipline | `supabase-postgres-best-practices` |
| 10 | QA | main session + Evidence Collector agent | `/verify`, `/run`, `/4`, TestHub flows | API Tester agent |
| 11 | Accessibility Auditor | Accessibility Auditor agent | `design:accessibility-review` | axe via Chrome MCP |
| 12 | Security Reviewer | `/security-review` + Security Engineer agent | `/security-review`, `oss-forensics` (deps) | Supabase `get_advisors` |
| 13 | Release Manager | main session | `deploy`, `/schedule` | §J manual path |
| 14 | Git/Merge Owner | main session (worktree law) | §J governance, `gh` CLI | `github-pr-workflow` (reference) |
| 15 | Regression Owner | main session | `regression` (merged version), route inventory | `hermes-pixel-probe` |
| 16 | Council Chair | main session | `llm-council`, `advanced-council` | `mega` (QUAR — only after review) |

---

## E. ROLE → SKILL → MODEL ROUTING TABLE

Model policy: **Fable/Opus for judgment, Sonnet for breadth, Haiku for mechanics.** Session model = Fable 5; route subagents down via `delegate` logic.

| Work shape | Model | Effort | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan Lock, architecture, council synthesis, security verdicts, merge decisions | Fable (session) | high | Judgment-dense, irreversible |
| Advisor drafts in councils, parallel discovery agents, code review finders | Sonnet | medium | Breadth beats depth; verified downstream |
| File sweeps, route inventories, grep-shaped audits, screenshot capture | Haiku | low | Mechanical; output verified by gates |
| Implementation slices (2h timebox) | Sonnet/Opus subagent or main session | medium | Plan Lock already made the decisions |
| Adversarial verify passes (regression, review verdicts) | Fable or Opus | high | Cheap finders + expensive judges |

Standing rule: **never let a Haiku-tier agent write code that ships; never spend Fable on a grep.**

---

## F. COUNCIL SOP

**Three councils, three jobs. Routing is mandatory — "council this" alone goes to llm-council.**

| Council | Job | When |
|---|---|---|
| `llm-council` | Decision tradeoffs (A vs B, is this the right move) | Any genuine tradeoff with stakes; <30 min |
| `advanced-council` | Pre-build contract for **big** features (new module, schema migration, workflow change) | After intake, before Plan Lock; produces VeriMAP Plan Lock |
| `preflight` embedded panel | Standard-feature planning | Default; runs inside /preflight, no separate invocation |

**Procedure (llm-council / advanced-council):**
1. **Intake:** Chair (main session) writes the question as a single falsifiable decision statement + context pack (files read, constraints from CLAUDE.md, prior decisions from `09_DECISIONS.md`).
2. **Decompose:** Chair splits into ≤5 advisor lenses (e.g., correctness, ADS/UX, data safety, delivery cost, regression risk). Domain-relevant lenses speak; no ceremonial seats.
3. **First responders:** evidence-holding lenses first (Data/Safety Guard, Canonical Discovery) — they can kill an option cheaply before opinion lenses spend tokens.
4. **Drafts:** advisors run as parallel Sonnet subagents, independent, no cross-talk.
5. **Peer review:** anonymized drafts cross-scored (llm-council method).
6. **Synthesis:** Chair (Fable) writes verdict: decision, rejected options + why, conditions, kill criteria.
7. **Authority:** **Vikram > active Plan Lock > Chair synthesis > individual advisor.** Council output is *advice* until written into `03_PLAN_LOCK.md` or `09_DECISIONS.md` — that write is what makes it binding (blind spot #3: council without authority is noise; authority = the artifact, not the meeting).
8. **Conflict rule:** two advisors disagree on a fact → probe the fact (code/DB/DOM), don't vote on it. Disagree on values → Chair decides, logs dissent in `09_DECISIONS.md`.
9. **Timebox:** one council per decision. No re-council without new evidence.

---

## G. PHASE-BY-PHASE SDLC SOP

Wrapper: everything below runs inside `activate feature <name>` / `continue feature <ID>` (`catalyst-feature`). No Feature Work ID + folder = no implementation. Every phase logs to the feature folder.

| # | Phase | Entry criteria | Owner | Skills | Artifact | Evidence | Fail condition | Rollback | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Intake | Request exists | Council Chair | `start`, `fable` | `01_OBJECTIVE.md` + falsifiable DoD list | Restated goal Vikram confirms | Ambiguous scope, no DoD | Discard folder | Vikram confirms objective |
| 2 | Product discovery | Objective approved | PO + BA | `deep-research`, market-intelligence, Product Manager agent | Discovery note in `02_CANONICAL_DISCOVERY.md` | Sources cited; existing-Catalyst overlap checked | "Build new" without reuse proof | N/A (paper) | Reuse-first verdict recorded |
| 3 | Requirements | Discovery done | BA | `story-writer` | Stories w/ Given/When/Then acceptance criteria | Each story testable; ≥1 unhappy path each | Vague criteria ("works well") | Rewrite | PO signs stories (blind spot #8) |
| 4 | IA / journeys | Stories signed | UX Researcher | `design:user-research`, Workflow Architect agent | Journey map incl. failure/empty/loading states | Every state named; zero-assumption rule applied | Happy-path-only map | Rewrite | Chair check: all states covered |
| 5 | UX/UI + design system | Journeys done | UI Designer + DS Auditor | Figma MCP, `design-intelligence`, `design:design-handoff` | Mockups + handoff spec, ADS tokens only | Design Intelligence Brief; canonical components named per CLAUDE.md hierarchy | Hand-rolled UI proposed; bare colors | Redesign | DS Auditor pass + canonical-component proof |
| 6 | Architecture | Design gated | Solution Architect | `preflight` (or `advanced-council` if big) | `03_PLAN_LOCK.md` | File list, forbidden files, wiring plan, validation commands, stop conditions | No timebox; >2h slices; files-forbidden empty | Discard plan | **Plan Lock approved by Vikram — no code before this** |
| 7 | DB/data model | Plan Lock live | DB Engineer | `supabase` plugin, migration ledger rules | Migration files in `supabase/migrations/` | `project-ref` asserted = cyij **before every batch**; ledger 1:1 with files; slug contract for URL-navigable tables | Prod ref detected; unregistered DDL; `:id` route param | Down-migration / restore staging | Schema probe proves columns exist (memory: marked ≠ executed) |
| 8 | Implementation | Schema proven | FE/BE Dev | `test-driven-development`, `mirror-component`, `subagent-driven-development` | Code on branch/worktree; `04_EXECUTION_LOG.md` | tsc clean (≤183 pinned), build passes, 2h slice log | Touching forbidden files; scope creep | `git restore` slice | Slice review vs Plan Lock |
| 9 | Unit/integration tests | Slice built | QA | TDD red-green evidence | Test files + run output | Raw test output pasted (not "tests pass") | Only happy paths; skipped tests | Fix or revert slice | All new behavior covered incl. failure paths |
| 10 | Accessibility | UI slice done | A11y Auditor | `design:accessibility-review`, Accessibility Auditor agent | A11y findings in `05_UI_UX_REVIEW.md` | Keyboard nav, focus ring (`--ds-border-focused`), roles/labels, contrast **in both themes**; dark mode via reload-into-dark (memory) | P0 barrier open | Fix before ship | Zero P0 a11y findings |
| 11 | Security | Feature code-complete | Security Reviewer | `/security-review`, Supabase `get_advisors`, `oss-forensics` for new deps | Findings list w/ verdicts | RLS on new tables proven by probe as anon; no secrets in diff; advisors clean | RLS missing; secret committed | Revert offending commit | Zero confirmed high findings. **Also runs early:** any new table/endpoint gets a mini security pass at phase 7 (blind spot #10) |
| 12 | Regression | All slices merged to feature branch | Regression Owner | `regression` (merged version) + route inventory + `hermes-pixel-probe` | Regression report | Route inventory diffed (`src/lib/routes.ts` + FullAppRoutes); 3 adjacent surfaces swept; screenshots of neighbors | Neighbor surface broken | Fix cluster or revert | Sweep clean (blind spot #4: inventory-driven, not vibes) |
| 13 | PR review | Regression clean | Git Owner | `/code-review` (high), `/verify` | PR (or main-push review record) | Review findings addressed or waived w/ reason; `/verify` drove the actual flow | Unreviewed diff; verify skipped | Close PR | Zero confirmed correctness findings |
| 14 | Merge to main | Review clean | Git Owner | §J governance, `deploy` | Merge commit | Commit-gate checklist (§J) all green | Any gate red | `git revert` merge | Ratchet gates pass in CI |
| 15 | Deployment | Main green | Release Manager | `deploy`, Supabase MCP (edge fns) | Deploy summary | Edge fns deployed + `get_logs` clean; staging app loads | CI red; edge fn 500s | Redeploy previous; revert | Post-deploy checks scheduled |
| 16 | Post-deploy validation | Deployed | QA + Release Manager | `/verify` on live staging, `/4`, `get_advisors`, `get_logs` | `06_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE.md` + closure screenshots | Live CRUD probe on canonical entity; error logs 15-min window clean | Live probe fails | Revert + incident note in `08_DRIFT_LOG.md` | **Vikram screenshot signoff = done** |

---

## H. EVIDENCE & ARTIFACT CHECKLIST

"Done" requires ALL applicable rows. A claim without its row is a claim, not a fact.

- [ ] Feature folder complete (`00`–`11` + `sessions/NNN_*.md` for this session)
- [ ] `03_PLAN_LOCK.md` approved before first code line
- [ ] Raw command output pasted for: tsc, build, tests, `lint:colors:gate`, `audit:ads:gate` (zero-output grep for bare colors)
- [ ] `lint:cre` pass if create/link surfaces touched
- [ ] Screenshots: every changed surface, **light + dark** (reload-into-dark), before/after where relevant — plus DOM/CSS probe (`/4` or pixel-probe) because screenshots don't prove computed styles (blind spot #9)
- [ ] Functional proof: `/verify` drove the real flow — not "typecheck passed"
- [ ] DB: `supabase/.temp/project-ref` output pasted for every linked batch; migration ledger 1:1
- [ ] RLS probe as anon for new tables
- [ ] Regression sweep report w/ named routes checked
- [ ] A11y pass note (keyboard, focus, labels, contrast)
- [ ] Security review verdicts (or "no security surface" statement w/ reason)
- [ ] Exact staged-file list (never `git add -A`)
- [ ] Post-deploy live probe + clean logs window
- [ ] Handover updated if context ends mid-feature (`07_HANDOVER.md`)

---

## I. FAILURE-MODE PLAYBOOK

| Failure mode | Control |
|---|---|
| Context drift / long session | `07_HANDOVER.md` + `obsidian` at context risk; continuation sessions MUST read 00/01/03/07/08/09 before acting; `fable` DoD list re-read each session |
| Duplicate work across sessions | One session = one worktree (CLAUDE.md hard stop); check `git reflog`/`ps` before blaming hooks; never commit files you didn't author |
| Hallucinated "done" | `fable` refuses done without per-criterion evidence; six-point self-verify (memory: mandatory); silence beats invented defaults (zero-assumption rendering) |
| Wrong-skill invocation | §C invocation rule (plain name = project); DECOM single-letter aliases A/B/C; after 30-day cleanup, one copy per name |
| Stale-tool poisoning | rtk proxy served pre-deletion grep results once (memory) — cross-check load-bearing greps with plain grep/ls |
| Skill estate rot | Quarterly: re-run this audit; README.md must list actual skills or say nothing |
| Memory pollution | Three lanes, no cross-writes: harness memory = durable session facts; `save-memory` = Obsidian vault notes (explicit ask only); `obsidian` skill = handovers. Hermes memory pack QUAR. Every memory: absolute dates, verify referenced files still exist on recall |
| Dark-mode regressions | Light-metaphor trap (memory): every dark defect = light idiom shipped into dark; probe via reload-into-dark only |
| DB disaster | Staging-first law: all DDL → cyij; prod lmqw only on explicit instruction via disposable linked dir; assert project-ref per batch; "cwd recovered" error = full stop |
| Branch disaster | No `git checkout` in checkouts you didn't create; land via detached worktree cherry-pick; `git add -A` banned |
| Merge w/o evidence | §J checklist is blocking; husky ratchets physically block bare-color increases |
| Security-at-the-end | Mini security pass at DB phase (RLS, advisors) + full pass pre-merge |
| Council noise | §F: decision statement in, artifact out, one council per decision |
| QA happy-path bias | Story gate requires ≥1 unhappy path per story; journey map must enumerate empty/error/loading states before design starts |
| Regression shallowness | Route inventory (routes.ts) is the sweep's input, not memory of "what's nearby" |

---

## J. MERGE-TO-MAIN GOVERNANCE

Standing authorization: direct push to origin/main allowed (memory `feedback_git_push`). Authorization ≠ absence of gates.

**Blocking checklist (in order):**
1. `pwd` + `git branch --show-current` + `git status --short -uall` — confirm you're in YOUR worktree, on the branch you think.
2. `/preflight` was run for this work (repo-impacting rule).
3. tsc / build / tests raw output green.
4. `npm run lint:colors:gate` + `npm run audit:ads:gate` pass (husky enforces anyway; run first, don't discover at commit).
5. `/verify` drove the changed flow end-to-end.
6. `/code-review` findings resolved; `/security-review` if auth/data/API surface touched.
7. `regression` sweep if UI/routes touched.
8. Stage **explicit files only** — every staged file authored this session.
9. Commit message approved format; push; confirm CI green.
10. Baselines: if a slice *reduced* color/audit counts, ratchet down (`--update`) and commit baseline.

**Banned:** `git add -A`/`.`, `--no-verify`, force-push, `gitmerge` skill (decommissioned), rebasing others' unpushed commits, merging with red CI.
**Conflict during merge:** stop, show conflict, decide with Vikram — never auto-resolve.
**Rollback:** `git revert <merge-sha>` (never reset --hard on shared main); DB: down-migration or staging restore; edge fns: redeploy previous version.

## K. COMMAND RECIPES

| Task | Recipe |
|---|---|
| New feature | `activate feature <name>` → discovery agents → `/preflight` (or `/advanced-council` if big) → Plan Lock → STOP for approval → build w/ TDD → §G phases 9–16 |
| Resume feature | `continue feature <CAT-...>` → rehydration report → proceed only if Plan Lock allows |
| Ambiguous request | `/start` → classify → proceed gate |
| Bug, unclear cause | `/systematic-debugging` → repro test (red) → fix (green) → `/verify` → `/4` evidence |
| Defect backlog | `/regression` → triage table → goahead → cluster fixes, one cluster/commit |
| "Make X look like Jira" | `/jira-compare <surface>` → diff table → PATCH cycle (cap 5) → CRUD acceptance |
| "Same table as X at Y" | `/mirror-component` (factory extract; never hand-rebuild) |
| Design signoff | `/design-critique <url>` → P0/P1 fixes → closure evidence block |
| Deep ADS audit | `/design-intelligence <surface>`; per-component: `/inspect audit` → `/inspect fix` |
| Decision w/ stakes | `/llm-council "<decision statement>"` → verdict → write `09_DECISIONS.md` |
| Pre-merge | §J checklist verbatim |
| Ship | `/deploy` (halts on conflict) → phase 16 validation |
| Visual proof | `/4 <url>` (screenshot + DOM probe tables) |
| Save durable lesson | harness memory (auto) or `anthropic-skills:save-memory` for vault — never both for same fact |
| End-of-context | update `07_HANDOVER.md` + `/obsidian` handover |

## L. 30-DAY CLEANUP ROADMAP

**Week 1 — delete the dead (zero risk):**
- `rm` empty stubs: project `skillui-catalyst/`, user `catalyst-feature/`, user `save-memory/`, user `user/` (empty lessons log)
- Delete user-level stale twins: `jira-compare` (catalyst-prod-44!), `design-critique`, `design-intelligence`, `systematic-debugging`
- Delete orphan `~/.claude/plugins/preflight/` + stale supabase 0.1.6 cache
- Fix project `preflight/SKILL.md:105` (`jahanarakhan` → repo-relative path); fix `/4`'s dead `/1` `/2` refs

**Week 2 — kill dangerous overlap:**
- DECOM `gitmerge` (project + Cowork); §J + `/deploy` replace it
- QUAR `hermes-jira-clone` (strip "no permission prompts" language if kept), `catalyst-clone` (remove CLAUDE.md auto-append), `mega`, hermes generic 8-pack
- DECOM aliases A/B/C; move widget-ban rule into CLAUDE.md once
- Fix `deploy` hardcoded repo slug; parameterize Supabase project id in the 5 skills that hardcode `lmqw...`

**Week 3 — merge and consolidate:**
- MERGE Cowork `regression` route-inventory content + `hermes-regression-sweep` into project `regression`; delete sources
- DECOM byte-identical Cowork dupes: `llm-council`, `gitmerge` (done wk2), `story-writer`, `jira-compare`, `catalyst-feature`, `council`
- Decide `catalyst-agent` vs `start` (merge or keep SPEC split)
- Rewrite `.claude/skills/README.md` + `AGENT_PIPELINE.md` to list the true canonical set; commit

**Week 4 — governance:**
- Read + classify the 4 un-inspected Cowork skills (market-intelligence, ui-ux-pro-max, ui-extraction, fable-prompt)
- Prune off-domain agent personas from project `.claude/agents/` (keep bespoke 8 + engineering/testing/design subset); user copy is enough for the rest
- Add this manual to the repo (`docs/ways-of-working/GOD_MODE_DELIVERY_MANUAL.md`) after Vikram review; link from CLAUDE.md supporting docs table
- Add quarterly skills-audit reminder (`/schedule`)
- Verify `delegate` hook scripts exist; wire or remove

*Cannot-confirm register: `market-intelligence`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `ui-extraction-react-replication`, `fable-prompt`, `mega` bodies not read in depth; `delegate` hook scripts not verified on disk; Cowork runtime resolution order vs Claude Code namespace not verified experimentally. Everything else above is grounded in file reads dated 2026-07-08.*
